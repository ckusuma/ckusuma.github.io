			<p>My name is Corvyn. Some call me Corvito, many call me Corv, and many of my gaming friends call me by my
			screen name: Dorfdude8. I am studying computer science with a focus on game development at the University of Southern California.</p>
			<p>I was born in Monterey Park, CA on May 13, 1998, and I lived in Chino Hills, CA for the first 6 years of my life before
			I moved up to Beaverton, OR. I was born to two Indonesian parents, both of whom were educated here in the U.S. (I'm currently attending
			my father's alma matter). I have one sister (8 years older than me) who is currently a Pharmacist residing in Seaside, OR.</p>
			<p>My hobbies include playing the trumpet, playing video games (obviously, since I'm a game major LOL), coding, and trying to be 
			the awesomest person I can be. For T.V. shows, I love <em>Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Grey's Anatomy, Psych,</em> and many
			old sitcoms such as <em>Full House</em> and <em>Family Matters</em>. Oh, and let's not forget about anime :3 I love <em>Ouran 
			High School Host Club, Bleach,</em> any anime made by <em>Key</em>, and the old <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> series. I absolutely ADORE Pokemon. I
			have literally played every single game in the series. Please do not make fun of my Pokemon k thnx :)</p>
			<p>I am a devout Christian, and I believe it's my faith that's keeping me strong and giving me a bright future. I consider Jesus Christ my savior,
			and I'm not afraid to show it.</p>
			<p>My dream is to become a fantastic game developer and to one day use games to make a powerful impact on kids all around the world
			using the procedural rhetoric that games have to offer. I have more recently gotten into Virtual 
			Reality development, as I believe that VR is the truest form of immersion there is. My goal as a 
			game developer has always been to create safe havens for people to turn to if they ever feel depressed, lonely, scared, 
			or tired of the current reality we are living in. I know that magic doesn't exist, but I try to make magic as real as
			I possibly can as a glimmer of hope for both myself and those around me.</p>
			<p>I'm not one for small-talk, but I certainly can empathize with others and give a shoulder to cry on when needed. I would certainly consider
			myself more an introvert than an extrovert, but nevertheless, I am a meticulous worker and I work well both individually and collaboratively</p>
