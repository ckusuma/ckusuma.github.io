			<h1> Flaming Ninja VR - My First VR Game! </h1>
			<p> <a href = "https://dorfdude8.itch.io/flaming-ninja-vr">Download the game here! </a> </p>
			<p>This is my first VR game for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Complements to Make School, an 8-week VR bootcamp that 
			taught me so much about Unity and VR-development! Flaming Ninja VR is a hack-and-slash, first-person shooter 
			virtual reality game. You have been transported into a futuristic Feudal Japan. You have lost all your memory, 
			including how you arrived at this new world, your identity, and your purpose to live. More severely, this world 
			is inhabited by evil, humanoid creatures that will attack you on sight. However, these creatures have one 
			weakness: Fire. Conveniently, you discover that you have acquired the ability to harness fire energy from his 
			environment into bladed weapons that you can either throw from your hands or shoot from your high-tech wrist guns. 
			Lost in this dangerous world, you assume the role of a ninja with one mission: to survive by scouring the land for 
			money and slaying the evil creatures around you by extracting fire from your surroundings. The more creatures you 
			defeat and loot you collect, the more you discover a sense of honor as a ninja, just within your reach. The 
			question is, will you claim it?  </p>

			<h1> Switch VR - A Multiplayer Thriller VR game! </h1>
			<p> <a href = "https://devpost.com/software/switch-vr"> View and Download here! </a> </p>
			<p> This project was created for Calhacks 2017! It's a multiplayer VR game where one player plays
			inside the VR headset (Oculus/Vive) while the other plays on the desktop PC. Both players are 
			placed inside a dark room with 6 lamps, and the goal of the desktop player is to turn off 
			all the lights of the scene while the goal of the VR player is to stop the desktop player from
			doing so in the alloted time period. The VR player can either shoot light bullets or call out
			voice commands (using Bing Speech-To-Text API from Microsoft Cognitive Services) to cast special attack,
			defense, and searching abilities.</p>

			<h1>Making a Game From Scratch!!!</h1>
			<p>The game can be played at <a href="https://csharp.itch.io/human-society-shelter">https://csharp.itch.io/human-society-shelter</a></p>
			<p>USC MEGA holds these cool things called "Game Jams", which are essentially 24-hour hack-a-thons dedicated specifically to 
			making games! I participated in it, and I teamed up with a group of 7 total people to build a game from the bottom-up. We 
			made a game called "Humane Society Simulator". The player plays as a dog who is trying to get adopted by customers at the pet store.
			The dog has various "stats" (cuteness, strength, endurance, etc.), and potential pet-owners at the store are looking for pets
			with a certain distribution of these stats. Your goal is to train your dog, through a series of mini-games, so that it resembles this
			ideal distribution of stats as closely as possible, thus allowing your dog to be picked over the other dogs in the store. Most of the members
			on the team each made a mini-game to contribute to the overall game, with one person doing soundtrack and another doing the art. Our 
			game won Best in Show for the Fall, 2016 GameJam, so we were pretty dang proud of that :]</p>

			<h1>Trojanator!</h1>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVIQUai6k8o">Watch Our Video Here!</a>
			<p>So this was a really gruelling process, considering my roommate and I have basically no experience with modeling or 3D printing
			whatsover...nevertheless, we made this guy in one semester! It's a 3D-printed model of a Trojan Action Figure that has recently
			been made the mascot of 3D4E at USC. This took a lot of time and effort, so we were really proud of how it turned out!</p>
		
			<p>The idea for this guy came to us right after our first meeting of 3D4E. My roommate and I were placed into an entirely new project group, 
			the "Animation" Team, and to be honest, we were clueless on what to do. I mean, this was the first time the club ever had an Animation
			team before. After the meeting ended and after walking around a bit in the cold, I suddenly thought of the idea to make superhero action figures,
			kind of like the "International Justice League of Super Acquaintances" from SpongeBob! Then I thought about Parks and Recreation, and how
			poor Ben Wyatt took forever just to shoot 5 seconds of his claymation movie. So I thought, "Hey, why don't we 3D-print action figures and
			make claymations out of them?" Of course, we knew that animating solid objects would prove challenging and tedious, but considering
			that was the only idea we could think of, we had no choice.</p>
			<p>First, we had to learn the entire interface of a modeling program. Because we were officially the "Animation" Team, we decided
			to learn AutoDesk: Maya 2016 and use that to model our little friend. Plus, we thought we could use the software to simulate our model's animations before
			we got around to physically animating it. My roommate designed all the concept art for the model (I'm not an artist), so we transfered his
			designs into Maya to use as references for sculpting and modeling. Sure enough, through a combined effort, it took us about 3 days to fully
			model the Trojan in Maya. In an even more surprising turn of events, it only took us <em>ONE print</em> to achieve a successful iteration
		    (we were REALLLLYYY lucky haha). Our year's worth of hard work paid off with the work of art you see in the video 
			link above. Super happy with the results :)</p>
