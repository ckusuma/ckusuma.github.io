			<center><h2>Why is this page here???</h2></center>
			<p>Whenever I'm really bored, depressed, angry, or otherwise emotional, I tend to want to write a lot because I simply can't bottle my feelings
			up. This is just a page for me to free write, record all my thoughts, vent, or otherwise write things that I want to write about. It happens very frequently,
			so expect some content to pop up here very soon (especially when midterms and finals start happening lol). If you want to read more,
			I usually write posts on Quora as well. You can find a link to my Quora profile under my "Contact Me!" page.</p><hr>
